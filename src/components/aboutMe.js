          Hello! I'm Mert Selamlar, from Istanbul, Turkey. I have a degree
          in English Language and Literature from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/dogus-university" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doğus University</a>, which has helped me create deep connections with
          people around the world and has made it easier for me to understand their cultures, which has greatly improved my communication skills. I'm a passionate developer with a
          love for creating innovative solutions. I enjoy working with modern web 
          technologies and continuously learning new skills to enhance my craft. I am 
          enthusiastic about collaborating on exciting projects and contributing to the 
          tech community. To enhance my skills, I have completed a comprehensive JavaScript
          course from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/aribilgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ari Bilgi Bilişim</a>, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in 
          web development. I currently divide my time between developing personal projects and solving algorithm problems to prepare for a career in the industry. I'm eager to apply my knowledge and grow as a developer.
